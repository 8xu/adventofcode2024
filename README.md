# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) programming puzzles. The challenges are solved using [Go](https://go.dev/), and each day's puzzle is implemented in its own folder.

According to [adventofcode.com/about](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
